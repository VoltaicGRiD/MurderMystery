# MurderMystery

## WORK IN PROGRESS

### Design and Development
A mobile application and physical board-game designed to replicate the feel of a Tabletop RPG game. A infinitely replayable Murder Mystery game that can be played by up to 8 players and can be controlled by the "host", a "game master" who controls the game.

Utilizies a varied story based on (presently) the following time periods:
- Medieval
- The Golden Age
- Modern Day
- Near Future
- Sci-fi

Along with action cards to allow players to interact with the game, and a cohesive gameplay structure.

### Creation of the App
The application is in a bare-bones state, but fully functional on all tested devices / Operating Systems:
- Android 10, 11, & 12
- iOS 15, 16

Additional work is needed to be put into the app and must be easily replicable to all other platforms, to include web and desktop.

### Creation of the Game
As of now, basic infrastructure is created, though missing base-line stories, prints of any action cards, documents, clues, and more.
