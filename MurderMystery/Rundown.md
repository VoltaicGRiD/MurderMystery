## Action Cards & Role Cards
### Keywords / Information
There are (200+) action cards and (3) role cards. These cards are dealt out to the table when the game starts, and additional action cards will be dealt out based on the game's flow.
As the game progresses, players will have opportunities to play an action card.

Action cards allow a character to perform an action during discussion, which may allow them to reveal information about a character, or, to allow the players an opportunity to have a private discussion with one or multiple other characters.
Role cards can never be the target of an action card, nor can they ever be "randomly" chosen. Role cards should be viewed by the player, then hidden away. Either given back to the host, or stored in the player's wallet, purse, or other location.

The initiator role can never change. They are and will always be the one who did it.
Non-role characters can become accomplices based on the actions they perform.
Accomplices can become non-role characters based on the actions they perform.

Some action cards are specific to a role, and can only be dealt to players that are that role.
These cards can be stolen / given to another player if that player plays a card that allows for that to happen. When this occurs, the player that took that card from the initiator / accomplice becomes an accomplice, if they weren't already one.
The host is responsible for identifying who took the card, and what the card was. As this information is relevant to the solution, and must be logged in the computer.

An action card is played to the host and ONLY to the host. To play a card, you place it face-down on the table and slide it to the host. The host then reads the card and provides a yes/no response to allow / disallow the usage of the card.
If the host opts to deny your request to play the card, you lose the card and cannot perform the action.
The host is responsible for allowing the cards to exist and be used, but their primary role is to ensure the fun continues. Therefore, they can deem an action as too revealing, unfair, or "not fun" (a.k.a. "because I said so")

Some action cards are designed for use in adult-only games and are NSFW and are NOT appropriate for people under the age of 18. These cards likely came in a seperate expansion.
These cards can vary in degrees of involvement and lewdity, and therefore, all players must agree with their usage before the game begins. If even a single player is uncomfortable with these cards, they must be replaced with the main game's cards, or another expansion.
If all players are willing, the host can remove particular cards from the deck, but must be fair to their removal. When a card is removed, any (even remotely) similar cards that are role specific (initiator / accomplice cards) must also be removed.

Your role determines your win condition, in coordination with the chosen solution. You are not directly informed of the win condition, and must determine if revealing the truth is in your favor, or if its in the favor of the rest of the party.

### Action Cards
Some examples of action cards and their potential are below:
- Pickpocket
	- While a discussion is on-going, secretly steal a single action card from another player
	- If you are caught stealing the card, you must deny that you had / played the pickpocket card
- Accuse
	- An opportunity to win the game! you must accuse the initiator AND accomplice(s) as well as the accomplice(s) roles in the event (if any) AND the method taken in the event (what weapon was used, what room did it take place in, etc.)
	- If and only if all the information is correct, you alone win the game
	- Otherwise, you automatically become the target of the next act, and you cannot win a prize and cannot be a participant in the final solution
- Redirect
	- Spill a drink, knock over a vase, or otherwise cause a ruckus to distract an on-going discussion from their conversation
	- You are responsible for any damage done, so you might as well make the best of the situation to change the direction of the discussion
- Bluff
	- Claim you did it, and you might as well throw your friend Timmy under the bus for being your accomplice
	- If the conversation is directed towards you, the host informs the computer of the change of direction
	- You are the automatic target of the final act, and if the initiator / accomplice(s) win, you do too
	- If the non-role characters win, you do not
- Search
	- Search another player's action cards, and select one to take for yourself
	- If you select a card that can only be dealt to the initiator and/or accomplice(s), you are now an accomplice
- Ignorance (ACCOMPLICE ONLY)
	- Claim ignorance and a general disobedience to participation in the event
	- If you manage to convince the rest of the party that you were not involved / not relevant, you aren't relevant, and are now a non-role character
	- Otherwise, you are the target of the next act
- Trade (INITIATOR ONLY)
	- If the action is approved, write down the name of your accomplice (if you know it) and the name of another player
	- If the claimed accomplice is, in fact, an accomplice, their role is replaced by another player. Their success now depends on the non-character roles finding the truth
	- The new accomplice is informed of their new role, and their success depends on the initiator / accomplice group finding the truth

## Acts / Arcs
### Keywords / Information
All acts are story arcs and all story arcs are acts. There is no individual character progression in this game.

When an act or an arc is generated, it will select a primary target for the act. 
This target might be the initiator or an accomplice, or they could be a non-role character that might have something to gain from participating in the event.
The purpose of targeting a character is to highlight why they may or may not be involved in the event.

The game is designed to allow the players to openly communicate about themselves and their roles without revealing the truth.

Depending on the solution selected by the host, players are given cards that help them discuss their situation and their character's motives and backstory without revealing their identity.
If the host selects a solution option that allows the initiator and accomplice(s) to know who they are, those players are made aware of their role, but are prohibited from discussing it at the table.

### AA 3
- Gives any and all final context for the event
- Points out multiple but not all characters and their motives
- Highlights the final piece of information necessary for the solution
- Provides the final clue for the solution
- Involves discussion between all characters
